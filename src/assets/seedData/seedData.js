But eating too many carrots can bring in too much beta-carotene the molecule responsible for carrots\' bright orange hue and a precursor of vitamin A. This can lead to excess blood carotene which can discolor the skin. Because of this I cannot reccomend, Tom Hanks just has too many carrots and I\' sick of them.',
